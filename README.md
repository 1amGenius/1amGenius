# Hi, I’m Armin Pakdaman 👋

Backend-focused Software Engineer with solid frontend experience. I build clean, scalable systems, care deeply about architecture, and enjoy turning complex requirements into maintainable solutions. My current focus is **.NET/C#**, **cloud-ready backend design**, and **well-structured APIs** that age gracefully.

By day, I work on production-grade .NET backends (AI camera systems, music institutions, hospital systems and and similar platforms). By night, I experiment recent techs with a **Telegram bot in .NET** to explore new patterns, tooling, and integrations.

## What I’m Up To

- 🔭 **Working on:**  
  Production .NET API backends, microservice-style systems, and experimental side projects.

- 🌱 **Currently learning:**  
  Practical software architecture—how to design systems that are simple, scalable, and easy to evolve.

- 👯 **Open to collaborating on:**  
  Backend-heavy projects, open-source contributions, and selective frontend work.

- 💬 **Ask me about:**  
  C#, .NET APIs, database design, Git workflows, and backend best practices.

- 📫 **Reach me at:**  
  **arminpakdamandev@gmail.com**

- ⚡ **Fun fact:**  
  I treat performance tuning like a logic puzzle—small changes, big wins.
